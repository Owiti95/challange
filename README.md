The Bank of Flatiron

Overview

The Bank of Flatiron is an expenditure tracker application designed to help users monitor and manage their financial transactions effectively. This tool enables users to record their transactions, view them dynamically, and keep track of their spending over time.

Features

- Transaction Entry: Users can add new transactions by filling out a form with details such as the transaction date, description, category, and amount.
- Dynamic Data Display: Transactions are displayed in a table format on the user interface as soon as they are added, providing real-time visibility into their spending.
- Search Functionality: Users can filter transactions by description using a search bar, making it easier to find specific entries.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible on various devices, ensuring a smooth experience across different screen sizes.

How It Works
